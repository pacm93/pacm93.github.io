### Mini bio

I received the B.Sc. in electronics engineering from the Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE), Brazil, in 2016. In 2014-2015, I did an exchange at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU), Germany. Currently, I am pursuing a M.Sc. in Communications and Multimedia Engineering at FAU.

I am interested, among other things, in multimedia signal processing, mathematical optimization and algorithm approximation for power and energy-constrained systems.
